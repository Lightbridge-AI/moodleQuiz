R package `{moodleQuiz}` contains high-level functions for cleaning, encoding, filtering, and combining student's score and responses from [Moodle Quiz report](https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Quiz_reports).

# Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Lightbridge-KS/moodleQuiz")
```

# Overview

The 4 main functions of the `{moodleQuiz}` are as follows:

-   `check_sub()`: check student's submission of the Moodle quiz report by looking at the `state` column.

-   `combine_resp()`: combine student's responses (`Response x`) from the Responses report.

-   `count_resp()`: count how many responses each student answered from the Responses report.

-   `combine_grades()`: filter, adjust, and combine student's grade from `Grade/xx` column.

All of theses 4 main functions are generic function that operate on **data frame** and **list of data frames** of Moodle Quiz report. The latter will be particularly useful when performing a data aggregation across multiple Moodle quiz report of the same type.

# Example

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(moodleQuiz)
library(dplyr)
```

Let's say I have a Moodle Grades Report data frame of "Quiz_1"

```{r}
glimpse(grades_ls$Quiz_1)
```

**Combine & Adjust Grades of Quiz 1**

How to choose the maximum score of each student and readjust maximum grades to 100?

Calling `combine_grades()` will do that in one step, plus it also cleans column names and extracts numeric student ID from Email address.

```{r}
grades_ls$Quiz_1 %>%
  combine_grades(
    extract_id_from = "Email address", # Extract Student ID from Email
    id_regex = "[:digit:]+", # Regular expression to extract student ID
    choose_grade = "max", # Choose only maximum grade of each student
    new_max_grade = 100 # Adjust maximum grade to 100
  ) %>%
  select(Name, ID, starts_with("G"), starts_with("Q"))
```

**Combine Grades for All Quizzes**

Supposed in a semester student have to do a graded assignment in a multiple quizzes, you can put each individual Grades Report in a list.

Now it's **a list of data frames** (here as `grades_ls`).

```{r}
grades_ls %>% 
  purrr::map_lgl(is.data.frame)
```

Supply a list of data frames into `combine_grades()`, you can *combine* and *weight* grades from **multiple quizzes** into one data frame with a sum of student's score in the `Total_x` column.

```{r}
grades_ls %>% 
  combine_grades(
    extract_id_from = "Email address", # Extract Student ID from Email
    id_regex = "[:digit:]+", # Regular expression to extract student ID
    choose_grade = "max", # Choose only maximum grade of each student
    new_max_grade = c(25, 25, 50) # Adjust maximum grade to 100
  ) %>% 
  select(Name, ID, contains("Grade"), starts_with("Total"))
```
