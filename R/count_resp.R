# Generic: Count Responses ------------------------------------------------


#' Count Student's Responses
#'
#'
#' [count_resp()] is a generic function that count responses per student from [Moodle Responses report(s)](https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Quiz_reports) (not Grades report).
#' Similar to [combine_resp()], if the Moodle responses report has response column(s) that contained [embedded answers (Cloze)](https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Embedded_Answers_(Cloze)_question_type),
#' you have an option to count them as a whole (1 Cloze column = 1 count) or as individual parts (count each parts of Cloze column, individually).
#' Other functionality are similar to [check_sub()] such as: encode & filter student's attempts by state (i.e., "Finished" or "In progress") and started time ("Started on" column),
#' cleans column names for easy manipulation, extracts student ID from "Email address", and unites "First name" and "Surname" column into "Name".
#'
#' @param data A data.frame **or** named list of data.frame of [Moodle Responses report(s)](https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Quiz_reports) (not Grades report)
#' @param extract_id_from (Character) Choose 1 column to extract ID from
#' @param id_regex (Character) A regular expression used to extract ID from column "Email address" in the Moodle Quiz report. The default is "`.*`" meaning all characters.
#'   If your student email addresses has numeric IDs in them, try "`[:digit:]+`" to extract digits from the email.
#'   **Note**: Regular expression syntax is the same as [stringr](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/strings.pdf).
#' @param sep_name A character in the new "Name" column that separate original "First name" and "Surname".
#' @param state A character vector to match values in "State" column of the Moodle Quiz report
#' @param encode An encoding numeric vector corresponding to `state`.
#'   For example: by default, in the "State" column, "Finished" values will be encoded as `1`, and
#'   "In progress" will be encoded as `0`.
#' @param choose_encode A character to filter student's attempt by the `encode`ing.
#'   * \strong{"max"} (default): return rows that have maximum encoding of each students.
#'   * \strong{"min"}: return rows that have minimum encoding of each students.
#'   * \strong{"all"}: no filter applied, return all rows.
#' @param choose_time A character to filter student's attempt by started time (determined by "Started on" column in Moodle Quiz report).
#'   This filter applies **after** `choose_encode` has been applied to the data.
#'   * \strong{"first"} (default): return rows that represent first attempt of each students.
#'   * \strong{"last"}: return rows that represent last attempt of each students.
#'   * \strong{"all"}: no filter applied, return all rows after applying `choose_encode`
#' @param count_cloze_parts (Logical) If a Moodle Responses report has at least one response column(s) that contained [embedded answers (Cloze)](https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Embedded_Answers_(Cloze)_question_type),
#'   set `count_cloze_parts = TRUE` will count individual parts of each Cloze columns. If `FALSE`, then it will count each Cloze column as 1 count.
#' @param filter_count (Character) One of "max" or "all". This filter option will apply after filter by `choose_encode` and `choose_time`.
#'   * \strong{"max"}: filter rows that has maximum response count per student. If there are â‰¥ 1 rows, filter the first one based on `Started`.
#'   * \strong{"all"}: No further filter apply.
#' @param sep_col (Character) If `data` is a named list of data.frame, `sep_col` indicate a character separation between names of list and "State" or "Count_resp" columns.
#'
#'
#' @return **A data.frame**, its output content is determined by class of its first argument: `data`.
#'   * If the `data` is a data.frame; the output is an encoded, filtered, and cleaned data.frame of Moodle Responses report.
#'   And the "Count_resp" column is added with maximum number of count appended at the column name.
#'   * If the `data` is a named list of data.frame; the output is the same as previously described, but all Moodle Quiz reports are [full-joined](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html) together by column "Name" and "ID".
#'   So that, "Count_resp" columns from each data.frame are sit together in a single data.frame, and "Total" column is added at the last column to indicate total count.
#'
#' @details **Counting Mechanism**:
#'   [count_resp()] gives 1 count to 1 responses cell if one or more characters were found.
#'   Blank or "-" (dash) response will not be counted.
